               Ecological networks are increasingly studied at large spatial scales, expanding their focus from a conceptual tool for community ecology into one that also adresses questions in biogeography and macroecology. This effort is supported by increased access to standardized information on ecological networks, in the form of openly accessible databases. Yet, there has been no systematic evaluation of the fitness for purpose of these data to explore synthesis questions at very large spatial scales. In particular, because the sampling of ecological networks is a difficult task, they are likely to not have a good representation of the diversity of Earth’s bioclimatic conditions, likely to be spatially aggregated, and therefore unlikely to achieve broad representativeness. In this paper, we analyze over 1300 ecological networks in the mangal.io database, and discuss their coverage of biomes, and the geographic areas in which there is a deficit of data on ecological networks. Taken together, our results suggest that while some information about the global structure of ecological networks is available, it remains fragmented over space, with further differences by types of ecological interactions. This causes great concerns both for our ability to transfer knowledge from one region to the next, but also to forecast the structural change in networks under climate change.

         <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
         <p>Ecological networks are a useful way to think about ecological systems in which species or organisms interact <span class="citation" data-cites="HeleGarc14 DelmBess18 PoisStou16">(Heleno et al. 2014; Poisot et al. 2016c; Delmas et al. 2018)</span>, and recently there has been an explosion of interest in their dynamics across large temporal scales <span class="citation" data-cites="BaisGrav19 TyliMorr17">(Tylianakis &amp; Morris 2017; Baiser et al. 2019)</span>, and especially along environmental gradients <span class="citation" data-cites="PellAlbo17 TrojOles16">(Trøjelsgaard &amp; Olesen 2016; Pellissier et al. 2017)</span>. As ecosystems and climates are changing rapidly, networks are at risk of unravelling: for example by invasion of destabilizing exotic species them <span class="citation" data-cites="MagrHolz17 StroLero14">(Strong &amp; Leroux 2014; Magrach et al. 2017)</span>, or by a “rewiring” of interactions among existing species <span class="citation" data-cites="HuiRich19 GuidBart19">(Guiden et al. 2019; Hui &amp; Richardson 2019)</span>. Simulation studies suggest that knowing the shape of the extant network is not sufficient <span class="citation" data-cites="ThomGonz17">(Thompson &amp; Gonzalez 2017)</span>, and that it needs to be supplemented by additional data on the species in the food web, climate, and climate projection.</p>
         <p>This renewed interest in ecological networks has prompted several methodological efforts. First, an expansion of the analytical tools to study ecological networks and their variation in space <span class="citation" data-cites="PoisCana12 PoisStou15 PoisGuev17">(Poisot et al. 2012, 2015, 2017)</span>. Second, an improvement in large-scale data-collection, through increased adoption of molecular biology tools <span class="citation" data-cites="EitzAbre19 EvanKits16">(Evans et al. 2016; Eitzinger et al. 2019)</span> and crowd-sourcing of data collection <span class="citation" data-cites="BahlLand16 RoyBaxt16 PocoRoy15">(Pocock et al. 2015; Bahlai &amp; Landis 2016; Roy et al. 2016)</span>. Finally, a surge in the development of tools that allow us to <em>infer</em> species interactions <span class="citation" data-cites="MoraMati15">(Morales-Castilla et al. 2015)</span> based on limited but complementary data on existing network properties <span class="citation" data-cites="StocPois17">(Stock et al. 2017)</span>, species traits <span class="citation" data-cites="GravPois13 DesjLaig17 BrouGrav17 BartGrav16">(Gravel et al. 2013; Bartomeus et al. 2016; Brousseau et al. 2017; Desjardins-Proulx et al. 2017)</span>, and environmental conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="GravBais18">(Gravel et al. 2018)</span>. These latter approaches tend to perform well in data-poor environments <span class="citation" data-cites="BeauDesj16">(Beauchesne et al. 2016)</span>, and can be combined through ensemble modeling or model averaging to generate more robust predictions <span class="citation" data-cites="PomeThom18">(Pomeranz et al. 2018)</span>. The task of inferring interactions is particularly important because ecological networks are difficult to adequately sample in nature <span class="citation" data-cites="Jord16 BanaCatt04 ChacVazq12 GibsKnot11">(Banašek-Richter et al. 2004; Gibson et al. 2011; Chacoff et al. 2012; Jordano 2016)</span>. The common goal to these efforts is to facilitate the prediction of network structure, particularly over space <span class="citation" data-cites="PoisGrav16 GravBais18 AlboArch19">(Poisot et al. 2016b; Gravel et al. 2018; Albouy et al. 2019)</span> and into the future <span class="citation" data-cites="AlboVele14">(Albouy et al. 2014)</span>, and to appraise the response of that structure to possible environmental changes.</p>
         <p>These disparate methodological efforts share another important trait: their continued success depends on state-of-the art data management. Novel quantitative tools demand a higher volume of network data; novel collection techniques demand powerful data repositories; novel inference tools demand easier integration between different types of data, including but not limited to: interactions, species traits, taxonomy, occurrences, and local bioclimatic conditions. In short, advancing the science of ecological networks requires us not only to increase the volume of available data, but to pair these data with ecologically relevant metadata. Such data should also be made available in a way that facilitates programmatic interaction so that they can be used by reproducible data analysis pipelines.</p>
         <p><span class="citation" data-cites="PoisBais16">Poisot et al. (2016a)</span> introduced <code>mangal.io</code> as a first step in this direction. In the years since the tool was originally published, we continued development of the data representation, amount and richness of metadata, and digitized and standardized as much ecological data as we could find. The second major release of this database contains over 1300 networks, 120000 interactions across close to 7000 taxa, and represents what is to our best knowledge the most complete collection of species interactions available.</p>
         <!-- TD: The final sentence is a strong statement. I don't disagree, but damn. I think I'm perhaps more on the side of "well this is what we have, let's try to correct for inherent biases and explore general relationships". Perhaps a few sentences could be included about using with this approach with the idea of a dynamic analysis, where analyses are automatically re-done as more data get added, allowing a sort of continuous assessment of proposed ecological relationships? -->
         <p>Here we ask if the current mangal database is fit for the purpose of global-scale synthesis research into ecological networks. We conclude that interactions over most of the planet’s surface are poorly described, despite an increasing amount of available data, due to temporal and spatial biases in data collection. In particular, Africa, South America, and most of Asia have very sparse coverage. This suggests that synthesis efforts on the worldwide structure or properties of ecological networks will be weaker within these areas. To improve this situation, we should digitize available network information and prioritize sampling towards data-poor locations.</p>

         <img src="figures/figure_01_a.png" alt="" /><figcaption><span>Figure 1:</span> Cumulative number of ecological networks available in <code>mangal.io</code> as a function of the date of collection. About 1000 unique networks have been collected between 1987 and 2017, a rate of just over 30 networks a year. This temporal increase proceeds at different rates for diferent types of networks; while the description of food webs is more or less constant, the global acceleration in the dataset is due to increased interest in host-parasite interactions starting in the late 1970s, while mutualistic networks mostly started being recorded in the early 2000s.</figcaption>
         </figure>
         </div>
         <p>The earliest recorded ecological networks date back to the late nineteenth century, with a strong increase in the rate of collection around the 1980s (fig. <a href="#fig:temporal">1</a>). Although the volume of available networks has increased over time, the sampling of these networks in space has been uneven. In fig. <a href="#fig:spatial">2</a>, we show that globally, network collection is biased towards the Northern hemisphere, and than different types of interactions have been sampled in different places. As such, it is very difficult to find a spatial area of sufficiently large size in which we have networks of predation, parasitism, and mutualism. The inter-tropical zone is particularly data-poor, either because data producers from the global South correctly perceive massive re-use of their data by Western world scientists as a form of scientific neo-colonialism <span class="citation" data-cites="MautParr13">(as advanced by Mauthner &amp; Parry 2013)</span>, thereby providing a powerful incentive <em>against</em> their publication, or because ecological networks are subject to the same data deficit that is affecting all fields on ecology in the tropics <span class="citation" data-cites="CollRam08">(Collen et al. 2008)</span>. As <span class="citation" data-cites="Brun10">Bruna (2010)</span> identified almost ten years ago, improved data deposition requires an infrastructure to ensure they can be repurposed for future research, which we argue is provided by <code>mangal.io</code> for ecological interactions.</p>

It is noteworty that the spatial coverage of these types of interactions is uneven; the Americas have almost no parasitic network, for example. Some places have barely been studied at all, including Africa and Eastern Asia. This concentration of networks around rich countries speaks to an inadequate coverage of the diversity of landscapes on Earth.</figcaption>

         <!-- TD: yikes. I can try to get the LNHM data per country formatted according to the mangal.io data requirements, but those also suffer from the sampling biases described. This would help the host-parasite networks look a bit better represented spatially, but the actual diversity of species and interactions is going to subjet to sampling effort (e.g., for some reason, we don't seem to have a good idea of host-helminth parasite relationships in North Korea). -->
         <!-- TD: in the analysis above, does this incorporate the density of the environmental space? I'm thinking that if the center of this environmental space is defined by the outer bounds, we could actually be misidentifying the center if a combination of environmental conditions is super common, but not in the center as determined by the extrema. This may just stem from my lack of understanding though. The mutualistic network bias could be a result of lots of plant-pollinator studies being conducted in tropical environments, right? -->
         <p><span class="citation" data-cites="Whit62">Whittaker (1962)</span> suggested that natural communities can be partitioned across biomes, largely defined as a function of their relative precipitation and temperature. For all networks for which the latitude and longitude was known, we extracted the value temperature (BioClim1, yearly average) and precipitation (BioClim12, total annual) from the WorldClim 2 data <span class="citation" data-cites="FickHijm17">(Fick &amp; Hijmans 2017)</span>. Using these we can plot every network on the map of biomes drawn by <span class="citation" data-cites="Whit62">Whittaker (1962)</span> (note that because the frontiers between biomes are not based on any empirical or systematic process, they have been omitted from this analysis). In fig. <a href="#fig:biomes">3</a>, we show that even though networks capture the overall diversity of precipitation and temperature, types of networks have been studied in sub-spaces only. Specifically, parasitism networks have been studied in colder and drier climates; mutualism networks in wetter climates; predation networks display less of a bias.</p>

Predation networks, <em>i.e.</em> food webs, seem to have the most global coverage; parasitism networks are restricted to low temperature and low precipitation biomes, congruent with the majority of them being in Western Europe.</figcaption>

         <p>Scaling up this analysis to the 19 BioClim variables in <span class="citation" data-cites="FickHijm17">Fick &amp; Hijmans (2017)</span>, we extracted the position of every network in the bioclimatic space, conducted a principal component analysis on the scaled bioclimatic variables, and measured their distance to the centre of this space (<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7B0%7D" alt="\mathbf{0}" title="\mathbf{0}" />). This is a measurement of the “rarity” of the bioclimatic conditions in which any networks were sampled, with larger values indicating more unique combinations (the distance was ranged to <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5D0%3B1%5D" alt="]0;1]" title="]0;1]" /> for the sake of interpretation). As shown in fig. <a href="#fig:ecc">4</a>, mutualistic interactions tend to have values that are higher than both parasitism and predation, suggesting that they have been sampled in more unique environments.</p>

         <!-- TD: What are the implications of this? Here, we assume that the composition of communities and interactions are determined by climatic constraints (right?). The intended message is that networks vary in climatic space (i.e., there is differential sampling of networks across environmental gradients). This differs as a function of network type. This gets at sampling effort, but not taxonomic bias (unless taxonomic bias is only to say that networks of different types are typically studied in different places within that climatic space). -->

         <h2 id="can-we-predict-the-future-of-ecological-networks-under-climate-change">Can we predict the future of ecological networks under climate change?</h2>
         <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of our knowledge on ecological networks is derived from data that were collected after the 1990s (fig. <a href="#fig:temporal">1</a>). This means that we have worryingly little information on ecological networks before the acceleration of the climate crisis, and therefore lack a robust baseline. <span class="citation" data-cites="DalsTroj13">Dalsgaard et al. (2013)</span> provide strong evidence that the extant shape of ecological networks emerged in part in response to historical trends in climate change. The lack of reference data before the acceleration of the effects of climate change is of particular concern, as we may be deriving intuitions on ecological network structure and assembly rules from networks that are in the midst of important ecological disturbances. Although there is some research on the response of co-occurrence and indirect interactions to climate change <span class="citation" data-cites="ArauRoze11 LosaScho17">(Araújo et al. 2011; Losapio &amp; Schöb 2017)</span>, these are a far cry from actual direct interactions; similarly, the data on “paleo-foodwebs”, <em>i.e.</em> from deep evolutionary time <span class="citation" data-cites="MuscPrab18 YeakPire14 NenzMont14">(Nenzén et al. 2014; Yeakel et al. 2014; Muscente et al. 2018)</span> represent the effect of more progressive change, and may not adequately inform us about the future of ecological networks under severe climate change. However, though we lack baselines against which to measure the present, as a community we are in a position to provide one for the future. Climate change will continue to have important impacts on species distributions and interactions for at least the next century [tk]. The Mangal database provides a structure to organize and share network data, creating a baseline for future attempts to monitor and adapt to biodiversity change.</p>
         <p>Possibly more concerning is the fact that the spatial distribution of sampled networks shows a clear bias towards the Western world, specifically Western Europe and the Atlantic coasts of the USA and Canada (fig. <a href="#fig:spatial">2</a>). This problem can be somewhat circumvented by working on networks sampled in places that are close analogues of those without direct information (almost all of Africa, most of South America, a large part of Asia). However, ?? suggests that this approach will rapidly be limited: the diversity of bioclimatic combinations on Earth leaves us with some areas lacking suitable analogues. These regions are expected to bear the worst of the socio-economical (<em>e.g.</em> Indonesia) or ecological (<em>e.g.</em> polar regions) consequences of climate change. All things considered, our current knowledge about the structure of ecological networks at the global scale leaves us under-prepared to predict their response to a warming world. From the limited available evidence, we can assume that ecoservices supported by species interactions will be disrupted <span class="citation" data-cites="GianCost17">(Giannini et al. 2017)</span>, in part because the mismatch between interacting species will increase <span class="citation" data-cites="DamiToug19">(Damien &amp; Tougeron 2019)</span> alongside the climatic debt accumulated within interactions <span class="citation" data-cites="Devivan12">(Devictor et al. 2012)</span>.</p>
         <h2 id="for-what-purpose-are-global-ecological-network-data-fit">For what purpose are global ecological network data fit?</h2>
         <p>What can we achieve with our current knowledge of ecological networks? The overview presented here shows a large and detailed dataset, compiled from almost every major biome on earth. It also displays our failure as a community to include some of the most threatened and valuable habitats in our work. Gaps in any dataset create uncertainty when making predictions or suggesting causal relationships. This uncertainty must be measured by users of these data, especially when predicting over the “gaps” in space or climate that we have identified. In this paper we are not making any explicit recommendations for synthesis workflows. Rather we this needs to be a collective process, a collaboration between data collectors (who understand the deficiencies of these data) and data analysts (who understand the needs and assumptions of network methods).</p>
         <p>One line of research that we feel can confidently be pursued lies in extrapolating the structure of ecological networks over gradients, not at the level of species and their interactions, but at that of the community. <span class="citation" data-cites="MoraGrav18">Mora et al. (2018)</span> revealed that all food webs more or less build upon the same structural backbone, which is in part due to strong evolutionary constraints on the establishment of species interactions <span class="citation" data-cites="DallStou15">(Dalla Riva &amp; Stouffer 2015)</span>; in other words, most networks are expected to be variations on a shared theme, and this facilitates the task of predicting the overarching structure greatly. Finally, this approach to prediction which neglects the composition of networks is justified by the fact that even in the presence of strong compositional turnover, network structure tends to be maintained at very large spatial scales <span class="citation" data-cites="DallPois17">(Dallas &amp; Poisot 2017)</span>.</p>
         <h2 id="active-development-and-data-contribution">Active development and data contribution</h2>
         <p>This is an open-source project: all data and all code supporting this are available on the Mangal project GitHub organization. Our hope is that the success of this project will encourage similar efforts within other parts of the ecological community. In addition, we hope that this project will encourage the recognition of the contribution that software creators make to ecological research.</p>
         <p>One possible avenue for synthesis work, including the contribution of new data to Mangal, is the use of these published data to supplement and extend existing ecological network data. This “semi-private” ecological synthesis could begin with new data collected by authors – for example, a host-parasite network of lake fish in Africa, or a pollination network of hummingbirds in Brazil. Authors could then extend their analyses by including a comparison to analogous data made public in Mangal. After publication of the research paper, the original data could themselves be uploaded to Mangal. This enables the reproducibility of this particular published paper. Even more powerfully, it allows us to build a future of dynamic ecological analyses, wherein analyses are automatically re-done as more data get added. This would allow a sort of continuous assessment of proposed ecological relationships in network structure. This cycle of data discovery and reuse is an example of the Data Life Cycle (as discussed by DataOne, [tk]) and represents one way to practice ecological synthesis.</p>
         <!-- TD: This could be a call to incorporate community level data into the network data. That is, a good measure of sampling bias might be the fraction of diversity represented in the sampled interaction network which is recorded in larger databases like GBIF (which of course have NO BIASES WHATSOEVER). The idea being that a poorly sampled network will also have a poor representation of a single trophic level compared to our existing knowledge of what's there. -->
         <!-- TD: worth discussing that baseline estimates may vary in their sampling effort or taxonomic resolution? The issue then could be not that we don't have information from the past, but that this information is simply less well-sampled/resolved relative to more current data on species interactions. It seems odd not to discuss niche limitations somewhere in the intro or here. Predicting the effect of climate change on ecological networks can be done at multiple levels. If I want to forecast the potential change in some high-level network property like connectance, I may be successful. If I wanted to predict how community composition and interactions between partners will change, that is a way tougher ask. I'd need information on what species can handle climatically, and how their interactions are mediated by climate (assuming non-neutral interactions...the presence of both species does not mean that they interact) -->
         <!-- TD: there could be an emphasis here on the development of tools to gauge sampling effort, or to account for variable sampling effort at network level. To draw an analogue, we cannot assume that species diversity at a single trophic level is well-sampled across large spatial or environmental gradients, so this is a general problem requiring a general solution. And it's not like it has stopped people (myself included) from examining large-scale relationships in parasite diversity, network structure, etc. This seems like an overly general question, where the question almost begs a negative response (i.e., global network data is garbage and we can't learn anything from it due to sampling biases and variable taxonomic resolution) -->
