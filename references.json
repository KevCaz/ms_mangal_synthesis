As a consequence, ecological networks have been placed in spatial and temporal contexts in order to reveal what may drive network variability. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecological networks, and in particular the underlying forces facilitating changes, seems pertinent in our attempts to understand and anticipate how ecological networks may vary and respond to future environmental scenarios.\n\n\n* Network variability has been studied at widely differing temporal and spatial scales. For example, studies exploring temporal variability ranges from within-season comparisons to comparisons over vast geological time spans, and the spatial extent ranges from the scale of a single pond to global analyses. Here, we highlight the outcomes from such studies and emphasize the identified mechanisms driving spatio-temporal variability in ecological networks. Specifically, we describe how ecological networks vary over different temporal (years, centuries and millennia) and spatial (local, regional and global) scales, discuss how this variability is monitored and identify potential future directions.\n\n\n* Present knowledge allows some tentative generalizations. First, ecological networks tend to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal stability in several macroscopic features (e.g. connectance, nestedness), but studies also show that macroscopic features may change, for example, in relation to mass extinction or steep environmental gradients. Secondly, microscopic features (e.g. individual specialization levels, species roles and partner affiliations), albeit less studied, seem to show strong variability, and in several cases, microscopic instability co-occurs with macroscopic stability. We therefore recommend a stronger focus on this macro–micro interplay and list ideas (e.g. temporal species centrality measures and interaction phenologies), towards expanding the microscopic toolbox of network ecologists.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12710/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2435.12710","ISSN":"1365-2435","title-short":"Ecological networks in motion","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Trøjelsgaard","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Jens M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"container-title-short":"Funct Ecol"},

Collections of well-studied food webs and replicate food webs from the same system that span biogeographical and ecological gradients now enable detailed, quantitative investigation of such questions and help integrate food web ecology and macroecology. Here, we integrate macroecology and food web ecology by focusing on how ecogeographical rules [the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Rapoport's rule] are associated with the architecture of food webs. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied All taxa. Methods We discuss the implications of each ecogeographical rule for food webs, present predictions for how food web structure will vary with each rule, assess empirical support where available, and discuss how food webs may influence ecogeographical rules. Finally, we recommend systems and approaches for further advancing this research agenda. Results We derived testable predictions for some ecogeographical rules (e.g. LDG, Rapoport's rule), while for others (e.g., Bergmann's and island rules) it is less clear how we would expect food webs to change over macroecological scales. Based on the LDG, we found weak support for both positive and negative relationships between food chain length and latitude and for increased generality and linkage density at higher latitudes. Based on Rapoport's rule, we found support for the prediction that species turnover in food webs is inversely related to latitude. Main conclusions The macroecology of food webs goes beyond traditional approaches to biodiversity at macroecological scales by focusing on trophic interactions among species. The collection of food web data for different types of ecosystems across biogeographical gradients is key to advance this research agenda. Further, considering food web interactions as a selection pressure that drives or disrupts ecogeographical rules has the potential to address both mechanisms of and deviations from these macroecological relationships. For these reasons, further integration of macroecology and food webs will help ecologists better understand the assembly, maintenance and change of ecosystems across space and time.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12925","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12925","ISSN":"1466-8238","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Baiser","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Cirtwill","given":"Alyssa R."},{"family":"Dunne","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Fahimipour","given":"Ashkaan K."},{"family":"Gilarranz","given":"Luis J."},{"family":"Grochow","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Li","given":"Daijiang"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."},{"family":"McGrew","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Romanuk","given":"Tamara N."},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Trotta","given":"Lauren B."},{"family":"Valdovinos","given":"Fernanda S."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Spencer A."},{"family":"Yeakel","given":"Justin D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]}},

As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12366","ISSN":"1469-185X","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Pellissier","given":"Loïc"},{"family":"Albouy","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Bascompte","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Farwig","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Loreau","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Maglianesi","given":"Maria Alejandra"},{"family":"Melián","given":"Carlos J."},{"family":"Pitteloud","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Rudolf"},{"family":"Saavedra","given":"Serguei"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Woodward","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Niklaus E."},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,22]]},"PMID":"28941124","container-title-short":"Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc"},

Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species’ phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species’ interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species’ interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3644","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.3644","author":[{"family":"Desjardins-Proulx","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Laigle","given":"Idaline"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]}},

Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact.

However, the accurate description of food webs requires significant effort in time and resources, limiting their widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently described methods, as well as describe a composite model of the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a large, well-described dataset. 2.Both niche and neutral processes are involved in determining whether or not two species will form a feeding link in communities. Three different models for determining niche constraints of feeding interactions are compared, and all three models are extended by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative abundances. The three models compared here infer niche processes through 1) phylogenetic relationships, 2) local species trait distributions (e.g. body size), and 3) a composite of phylogeny and local traits. 3.We show that all three methods perform well at predicting individual species interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up to the network level, resulting in food-web structure of inferred networks being similar to their empirical counterparts. 4.Our results indicate that inferring food-web structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test of changes in food-web structure, particularly when there is low species turnover between sites.

However, networks in the grasslands were resistant to these reductions, since mainly abundant and highly mobile species were attracted. Nonetheless, simulations indicated that network structural changes could be triggered if >50% of individuals were attracted to the crop (a value well-above that found in our study system), which could affect community stability and resilience to further disturbance.

  {"id":"StroLero14","type":"article-journal","title":"Impact of Non-Native Terrestrial Mammals on the Structure of the Terrestrial Mammal Food Web of Newfoundland, Canada","container-title":"PLOS ONE","page":"e106264","volume":"9","issue":"8","source":"PLoS Journals","abstract":"The island of Newfoundland is unique because it has as many non-native terrestrial mammals as native ones. The impacts of non-native species on native flora and fauna can be profound and invasive species have been identified as one of the primary drivers of species extinction. Few studies, however, have investigated the effects of a non-native species assemblage on community and ecosystem properties. We reviewed the literature to build the first terrestrial mammal food web for the island of Newfoundland and then used network analyses to investigate how the timing of introductions and trophic position of non-native species has affected the structure of the terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland. The first non-native mammals (house mouse and brown rat) became established in Newfoundland with human settlement in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Coyotes and southern red-backed voles are the most recent mammals to establish themselves on the island in 1985 and 1998, respectively. The fraction of intermediate species increased with the addition of non-native mammals over time whereas the fraction of basal and top species declined over time. This increase in intermediate species mediated by non-native species arrivals led to an overall increase in the terrestrial mammal food web connectance and generality (i.e. mean number of prey per predator). This diverse prey base and sources of carrion may have facilitated the natural establishment of coyotes on the island. Also, there is some evidence that the introduction of non-native prey species such as the southern red-backed vole has contributed to the recovery of the threatened American marten. Long-term monitoring of the food web is required to understand and predict the impacts of the diverse novel interactions that are developing in the terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland.","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106264","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0106264","ISSN":"1932-6203","author":[{"family":"Strong","given":"Justin S."},{"family":"Leroux","given":"Shawn J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,15]]},"container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"}
