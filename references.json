The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12002/full","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12002","ISSN":"1461023X","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Canard","given":"Elsa"},{"family":"Mouillot","given":"David"},{"family":"Mouquet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,2]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol.

As a consequence, ecological networks have been placed in spatial and temporal contexts in order to reveal what may drive network variability. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecological networks, and in particular the underlying forces facilitating changes, seems pertinent in our attempts to understand and anticipate how ecological networks may vary and respond to future environmental scenarios.\n\n\n* Network variability has been studied at widely differing temporal and spatial scales. For example, studies exploring temporal variability ranges from within-season comparisons to comparisons over vast geological time spans, and the spatial extent ranges from the scale of a single pond to global analyses. Here, we highlight the outcomes from such studies and emphasize the identified mechanisms driving spatio-temporal variability in ecological networks. Specifically, we describe how ecological networks vary over different temporal (years, centuries and millennia) and spatial (local, regional and global) scales, discuss how this variability is monitored and identify potential future directions.\n\n\n* Present knowledge allows some tentative generalizations. First, ecological networks tend to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal stability in several macroscopic features (e.g. connectance, nestedness), but studies also show that macroscopic features may change, for example, in relation to mass extinction or steep environmental gradients. Secondly, microscopic features (e.g. individual specialization levels, species roles and partner affiliations), albeit less studied, seem to show strong variability, and in several cases, microscopic instability co-occurs with macroscopic stability. We therefore recommend a stronger focus on this macro–micro interplay and list ideas (e.g. temporal species centrality measures and interaction phenologies), towards expanding the microscopic toolbox of network ecologists.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12710/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2435.12710","ISSN":"1365-2435","title-short":"Ecological networks in motion","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Trøjelsgaard","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Jens M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"container-title-short":"Funct Ecol"},

Collections of well-studied food webs and replicate food webs from the same system that span biogeographical and ecological gradients now enable detailed, quantitative investigation of such questions and help integrate food web ecology and macroecology. Here, we integrate macroecology and food web ecology by focusing on how ecogeographical rules [the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Rapoport's rule] are associated with the architecture of food webs. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied All taxa. Methods We discuss the implications of each ecogeographical rule for food webs, present predictions for how food web structure will vary with each rule, assess empirical support where available, and discuss how food webs may influence ecogeographical rules. Finally, we recommend systems and approaches for further advancing this research agenda. Results We derived testable predictions for some ecogeographical rules (e.g. LDG, Rapoport's rule), while for others (e.g., Bergmann's and island rules) it is less clear how we would expect food webs to change over macroecological scales. Based on the LDG, we found weak support for both positive and negative relationships between food chain length and latitude and for increased generality and linkage density at higher latitudes. Based on Rapoport's rule, we found support for the prediction that species turnover in food webs is inversely related to latitude. Main conclusions The macroecology of food webs goes beyond traditional approaches to biodiversity at macroecological scales by focusing on trophic interactions among species. The collection of food web data for different types of ecosystems across biogeographical gradients is key to advance this research agenda. Further, considering food web interactions as a selection pressure that drives or disrupts ecogeographical rules has the potential to address both mechanisms of and deviations from these macroecological relationships. For these reasons, further integration of macroecology and food webs will help ecologists better understand the assembly, maintenance and change of ecosystems across space and time.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12925","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12925","ISSN":"1466-8238","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Baiser","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Cirtwill","given":"Alyssa R."},{"family":"Dunne","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Fahimipour","given":"Ashkaan K."},{"family":"Gilarranz","given":"Luis J."},{"family":"Grochow","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Li","given":"Daijiang"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."},{"family":"McGrew","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Romanuk","given":"Tamara N."},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Trotta","given":"Lauren B."},{"family":"Valdovinos","given":"Fernanda S."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Spencer A."},{"family":"Yeakel","given":"Justin D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]}},

As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12366","ISSN":"1469-185X","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Pellissier","given":"Loïc"},{"family":"Albouy","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Bascompte","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Farwig","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Loreau","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Maglianesi","given":"Maria Alejandra"},{"family":"Melián","given":"Carlos J."},{"family":"Pitteloud","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Rohr","given":"Rudolf"},{"family":"Saavedra","given":"Serguei"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Woodward","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Niklaus E."},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,22]]},"PMID":"28941124","container-title-short":"Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc"},

Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species’ phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species’ interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species’ interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3644","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.3644","author":[{"family":"Desjardins-Proulx","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Laigle","given":"Idaline"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]}},

Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact.

However, the accurate description of food webs requires significant effort in time and resources, limiting their widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently described methods, as well as describe a composite model of the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a large, well-described dataset. 2.Both niche and neutral processes are involved in determining whether or not two species will form a feeding link in communities. Three different models for determining niche constraints of feeding interactions are compared, and all three models are extended by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative abundances. The three models compared here infer niche processes through 1) phylogenetic relationships, 2) local species trait distributions (e.g. body size), and 3) a composite of phylogeny and local traits. 3.We show that all three methods perform well at predicting individual species interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up to the network level, resulting in food-web structure of inferred networks being similar to their empirical counterparts. 4.Our results indicate that inferring food-web structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test of changes in food-web structure, particularly when there is low species turnover between sites.

They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients.\n\n\n* We use three case studies to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator–prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore–plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant–pollinator systems).\n\n\n* Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem functioning.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12666/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2435.12666","ISSN":"1365-2435","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bartomeus","given":"Ignasi"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Tylianakis","given":"Jason M."},{"family":"Aizen","given":"Marcelo A."},{"family":"Dickie","given":"Ian A."},{"family":"Bernard-Verdier","given":"Maud"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,2]]},"container-title-short":"Funct Ecol"},

Here, we characterised which pollinator species are attracted by oilseed rape and how this affected the structure of plant-pollinator networks in nearby grasslands. We surveyed 177 networks from three countries (Germany, Sweden and United Kingdom) in 24 landscapes with high crop cover, and compared them to 24 landscapes with low or no oilseed rape during and after crop blooming. On average 55% of grassland pollinator species were found on the crop, which attracted 8-35% of individuals away from grasslands. However, networks in the grasslands were resistant to these reductions, since mainly abundant and highly mobile species were attracted. Nonetheless, simulations indicated that network structural changes could be triggered if >50% of individuals were attracted to the crop (a value well-above that found in our study system), which could affect community stability and resilience to further disturbance.

The impacts of non-native species on native flora and fauna can be profound and invasive species have been identified as one of the primary drivers of species extinction. Few studies, however, have investigated the effects of a non-native species assemblage on community and ecosystem properties. We reviewed the literature to build the first terrestrial mammal food web for the island of Newfoundland and then used network analyses to investigate how the timing of introductions and trophic position of non-native species has affected the structure of the terrestrial mammal food web in Newfoundland. The first non-native mammals (house mouse and brown rat) became established in Newfoundland with human settlement in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Coyotes and southern red-backed voles are the most recent mammals to establish themselves on the island in 1985 and 1998, respectively. The fraction of intermediate species increased with the addition of non-native mammals over time whereas the fraction of basal and top species declined over time. This increase in intermediate species mediated by non-native species arrivals led to an overall increase in the terrestrial mammal food web connectance and generality (i.e. mean number of prey per predator). This diverse prey base and sources of carrion may have facilitated the natural establishment of coyotes on the island. Also, there is some evidence that the introduction of non-native prey species such as the southern red-backed vole has contributed to the recovery of the threatened American marten. Long-term monitoring of the food web is required to understand and predict the impacts of the diverse novel interactions that are developing in the terrestrial mammal food web of Newfoundland.","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106264","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0106264","ISSN":"1932-6203","author":[{"family":"Strong","given":"Justin S."},{"family":"Leroux","given":"Shawn J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,15]]},"container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

However, the consequences of such changes on community structure are still poorly understood, particularly the impacts on food-web properties. Here, we propose a new framework, coupling species distribution and trophic models, to predict climate change impacts on food-web structure across the Mediterranean Sea. Sea surface temperature was used to determine the fish climate niches and their future distributions. Body size was used to infer trophic interactions between fish species. Our projections reveal that 54 fish species of 256 endemic and native species included in our analysis would disappear by 2080–2099 from the Mediterranean continental shelf. The number of feeding links between fish species would decrease on 73.4% of the continental shelf. However, the connectance of the overall fish web would increase on average, from 0.26 to 0.29, mainly due to a differential loss rate of feeding links and species richness. This result masks a systematic decrease in predator generality, estimated here as the number of prey species, from 30.0 to 25.4. Therefore, our study highlights large-scale impacts of climate change on marine food-web structure with potential deep consequences on ecosystem functioning. However, these impacts will likely be highly heterogeneous in space, challenging our current understanding of climate change impact on local marine ecosystems.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12467","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.12467","ISSN":"1365-2486","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Albouy","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Velez","given":"Laure"},{"family":"Coll","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Colloca","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Loc'h","given":"François Le"},{"family":"Mouillot","given":"David"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]}},

Compliance with these policies has been hampered by reluctance, amongst many social and natural scientists, to release data on an open access basis. Dominant approaches to tackling data sharing obstacles focus on methodological, ethical, legal, scientific and technological infrastructures. This article explores barriers to data sharing through examination of the changing conditions and practices of data sharing; specifically, the recent introduction of digital data sharing policies and their institutionalization of open access as a normative data sharing model. The scientific, moral and political assumptions underpinning open access digital data sharing policies and principles are examined, and their implications considered for data sharing practices. The paper suggests that data sharing obstacles may be understood in terms of a policy–practice divide, whereby data sharing policies fail to recognize data sharing as a relational practice. In conclusion, alternative relational approaches to data sharing policies are proposed, drawing on the Mass Observation Archive guidelines as a useful illustrative model.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2012.760663","DOI":"10.1080/02691728.2012.760663","ISSN":"0269-1728","title-short":"Open Access Digital Data Sharing","author":[{"family":"Mauthner","given":"Natasha Susan"},{"family":"Parry","given":"Odette"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,18]]}},

One important example of this, the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010 target, is soon approaching. The target set is to significantly reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by the year 2010. However, to what extent are the data, especially for tropical countries, available to indicate biodiversity change and to what extent is current knowledge of biodiversity change truly a global picture? While species richness is greatest in the tropics, biodiversity data richness is skewed towards the poles. This not only provides a significant challenge for global indicators to accurately represent biodiversity, but also for individual countries that are responsible under such legislation for measuring their own impact on biodiversity. We examine the coverage of biodiversity data using four global biodiversity datasets, and look at how effective current efforts are at addressing this discrepancy, and what countries might be able to do in time for 2010 and beyond.

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to gut content analysis, thereby deriving a new perspective on community interactions and their responses to environment. For this, we use an elevational gradient in the High Arctic, asking how the environment and species traits interact in shaping predator–prey interactions involving the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis. To characterize the community of potential prey available to this predator, we used pitfall trapping and vacuum sampling. To characterize the prey actually consumed, we applied molecular gut content analysis. Using joint species distribution models, we found elevation and vegetation mass to explain the most variance in the composition of the prey community locally available. However, such environmental variables had only a small effect on the prey community found in the spider's gut. These observations indicate that Pardosa exerts selective feeding on particular taxa irrespective of environmental constraints. By directly modelling the probability of predation based on gut content data, we found that neither trait matching in terms of predator and prey body size nor phylogenetic or environmental constraints modified interaction probability. Our results indicate that taxonomic identity may be more important for predator–prey interactions than environmental constraints or prey traits. The impact of environmental change on predator–prey interactions thus appears to be indirect and mediated by its imprint on the community of available prey.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14872","DOI":"10.1111/mec.14872","ISSN":"1365-294X","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Eitzinger","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Abrego","given":"Nerea"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Huotari","given":"Tea"},{"family":"Vesterinen","given":"Eero J."},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,19]]}},

These efforts frequently emphasize restoration or planting of flowering plants to provide pollen and nectar resources that are highly attractive to the desired pollinators. However, determining exactly which plant species should be used to enhance a landscape is difficult. Empirical screening of plants for such purposes is logistically daunting, but could be streamlined by crowdsourcing data to create lists of plants most probable to attract the desired pollinator taxa. People frequently photograph plants in bloom and the Internet has become a vast repository of such images. A proportion of these images also capture floral visitation by arthropods. Here, we test the hypothesis that the abundance of floral images containing identifiable pollinator and other beneficial insects is positively associated with the observed attractiveness of the same species in controlled field trials from previously published studies. We used Google Image searches to determine the correlation of pollinator visitation captured by photographs on the Internet relative to the attractiveness of the same species in common-garden field trials for 43 plant species. From the first 30 photographs, which successfully identified the plant, we recorded the number of Apis (managed honeybees), non-Apis (exclusively wild bees) and the number of bee-mimicking syrphid flies. We used these observations from search hits as well as bloom period (BP) as predictor variables in Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for field-observed abundances of each of these groups. We found that non-Apis bees observed in controlled field trials were positively associated with observations of these taxa in Google Image searches (pseudo-R2 of 0.668). Syrphid fly observations in the field were also associated with the frequency they were observed in images, but this relationship was weak. Apis bee observations were not associated with Internet images, but were slightly associated with BP. Our results suggest that passively crowdsourced image data can potentially be a useful screening tool to identify candidate plants for pollinator habitat restoration efforts directed at wild bee conservation. Increasing our understanding of the attractiveness of a greater diversity of plants increases the potential for more rapid and efficient research in creating pollinator-supportive landscapes.","URL":"http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/6/150677","DOI":"10.1098/rsos.150677","ISSN":"2054-5703","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bahlai","given":"Christie A."},{"family":"Landis","given":"Douglas A."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,18]]}},

Methodology / Principal Findings The Big Bumblebee Discovery was a one-year citizen science project run by a partnership of EDF Energy, the British Science Association and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology which sought to assess the influence of the landscape at multiple scales on the diversity and abundance of bumblebees. Timed counts of bumblebees (Bombus spp.; identified to six colour groups) visiting focal plants of lavender (Lavendula spp.) were carried out by about 13 000 primary school children (7–11 years old) from over 4000 schools across the UK. 3948 reports were received totalling 26 868 bumblebees. We found that while the wider landscape type had no significant effect on reported bumblebee abundance, the local proximity to flowers had a significant effect (fewer bumblebees where other flowers were reported to be >5m away from the focal plant). However, the rate of mis-identifcation, revealed by photographs uploaded by participants and a photo-based quiz, was high. Conclusions / Significance Our citizen science results support recent research on the importance of local flocal resources on pollinator abundance. Timed counts of insects visiting a lure plant is potentially an effective approach for standardised pollinator monitoring, engaging a large number of participants with a simple protocol. However, the relatively high rate of mis-identifications (compared to reports from previous pollinator citizen science projects) highlights the importance of investing in resources to train volunteers. Also, to be a scientifically valid method for enquiry, citizen science data needs to be sufficiently high quality, so receiving supporting evidence (such as photographs) would allow this to be tested and for records to be verified.","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150794","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0150794","ISSN":"1932-6203","title-short":"Focal Plant Observations as a Standardised Method for Pollinator Monitoring","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Roy","given":"Helen E."},{"family":"Baxter","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Aoine"},{"family":"Pocock","given":"Michael J.
